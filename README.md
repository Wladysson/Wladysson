![Minha Foto](/fundogit.png)

Professional with a solid foundation in Java and Spring development, data analysis and technical support, currently focused on evolving into strategic areas such as Cloud Computing, Data Engineering and Infrastructure Automation, working in a practical and analytical way, using modern tools such as Power BI and advanced Excel to transform data into valuable insights, supporting decisions and optimizing processes.

In recent years, I have dedicated even more of my professional and educational efforts to Java, Terraform and cloud computing with AWS, focusing on building scalable, resilient and secure environments in the provisioning and management of services such as:

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for managing Linux/Windows instances, including remote access, autoscaling and permission control with IAM;

S3 for storing objects with versioning, access policies and integration with web applications;

IAM, applying good practices for segregation of duties, security policies (JSON), MFA and roles between accounts and services;

RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for managed relational databases, with automated snapshots, replication and performance tuning;
VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway and Security Groups, structuring isolated and secure environments for production and testing;
Lambda, EventBridge and CloudWatch, composing serverless, event-driven solutions with integrated observability;
Route 53 and CloudFront for managed DNS and low-latency content delivery;
Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with automated provisioning, modularization and versioning of complete environments via Git.

I believe that the cloud goes beyond "uploading files" ‚Äî it requires strategic architecture, cost control, automation, security and performance, all aligned with the business reality.
Currently, I am also deepening my knowledge in SQL and automation and API manipulation, data structures, algorithms and DevOps fundamentals in order to build modern, secure and scalable solutions.

I am constantly evolving and continuously learning, seeking challenges that allow me to grow professionally and contribute to projects with purpose and real impact.
